# git_for_R

This repository contains files for the
webinar **Using Git and GitHub with R**
presented through CWRA/CSHS on June 3, 2020, by 
Kevin Shook and Rob Chlumsky. 

The main folder contains the R presentation; figures used
by the presentation are in \figures.

The folder \exercises contains exercises which can be done as a 
follow-up to the webinar.

The folder \setup contains an *R* script `install_R_packages_gitwebinar.R`
which installs several *R* packages and tests that *git* is
installed. Please run this script before trying any of the 
examples or attempting the exercises.

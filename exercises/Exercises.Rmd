## Instructions
Try the following exercises. First load and run the file
`install_R_packages_gitwebinar.R` from the `/setup` folder,
which will check that you have git installed on your system,
and will download all of the required **R** packages.

## Exercises
1. Go to GitHub and create an account

2. Clone the presentation repository to your local computer. Using https, the
address is `https://github.com/CentreForHydrology/git_for_R.git`. If you have ssh installed
and configured, you can use the address `git@github.com:CentreForHydrology/git_for_R.git`.

3. Delete the file `this_file_is_junk.txt` from the local repo. It
is inside the `/exercises` folder.

4. Commit the changes to your local repo.

5. Fork the GitHub repository `CSHS-CWRA/CSHShydRology`
to your account.

6. Create a local version of the `CSHShydRology` package on your own computer by creating a new project. 

7. Build the package. Check to see that it builds properly. For more in-depth checking, use the **Check** command.

8. Create a branch called `testing` for the CSHShydRology repo on your computer (and on your fork on GitHub)

9. Copy the file `??` from the `/exercises` folder of the presentation repository, to the `/code` directory of the `testing` branch.

10. Commit the changes to the local repo and push the commit to GitHub.

11. Check the `testing` branch. Does the package build properly? If not, change back to the `master` branch and build the package.
